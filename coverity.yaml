analyze:
  # Specifies the aggressiveness level for the analysis. The aggressiveness
  # level causes the analysis to make more or less aggressive assumptions
  # during the analysis where the higher the aggressiveness level the more
  # defects are reported.
  # Valid values:
  #   low
  #   medium
  #   high
  aggressiveness-level: high

  checkers:
    # Indicates whether all checkers should be enabled.
    all: true

      CONFIG.HARDCODED_CREDENTIALS_AUDIT:
        enabled: true

    # Specifies how web application security analysis should be done.
    webapp-security:
      # Enables the checkers that are used for web application security
      # analysis.
      enabled: true

      # Sets the web application checkers aggressiveness level.
      # Valid values:
      #   low
      #   medium
      #   high
      aggressiveness-level: high

  # Analysis mode: "pfi" (perfect fidelity incremental) for complete analysis;
  # or "hfi" (high fidelity incremental) for analysis of only specific files
  # specified by analyze.files settings, omitting any other files which may
  # have been incidentally captured by the build. An "hfi" analysis can be
  # faster but may produce results which are incomplete or inconsistent, due to
  # the lack of context, and should be used only when speed is more important
  # than accuracy.
  # Valid values:
  #   hfi
  #   pfi
